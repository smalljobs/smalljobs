## Development

* [GitHub](https://github.com/smalljobs/smalljobs) for source code management.
* [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/smalljobs/resources) for production hosting.

### Running locally

Make sure [Ruby 2](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) are installed. Also PostgreSQL
should be accessible with the user `smalljobs` without password.


#### Clone the repo

Get the source by cloning the repo:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ratte/smalljobs.git
$ cd smalljobs
```

#### Prepare the database

Get the database ready and populate with needed data:

```bash
$ rake db:setup
```

Alternatively you can sync the production database to your local database:

```bash
$ heroku pg:pull DATABASE_URL smalljobs_development
```

#### Start the server

Start the local [unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/) server

```bash
$ RAILS_ENV=development bundle exec unicorn -p 3000 -c config/unicorn.rb
```

and open [the site](http://dev.smalljobs.ch:3000/) or the [admin interface](http://dev.smalljobs.ch:3000/admin).


#### Update to latest version

You can update your local project with:

```bash
$ cd smalljobs
$ git pull origin master
$ rake db:migrate
```

#### Vagrant Box

If you want to test the Application in a proper environment, use Vagrant/Virtualbox for testing:

```bash
$ vagrant up
$ ssh vagrant
$ cd /vagrant
```
Handling of [vagrant-Box](/puppet/README.md)

### Docker Localy

If you want start fast with docker

* install docker
* install docker-compose

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:smalljobs/smalljobs.git
$ cd smalljobs/docker/docker_smalljobs
```
You must edit docker-compose.yml and then

```bash
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d
```
And everything will be built

#### Start docker 
```bash
$ docker-compose stop
```
#### Stop docker 
```bash
$ docker-compose start
```
#### Login to docker and start server
```bash
$ docker exec -it smalljob_docker_web_1 /bin/bash --login -c "stty rows 60 && stty cols 250 && bash --login"
$ foreman start
```

#### Local SMPT Server

If you want to preview the app emails, you need to install [MailCatcher](http://mailcatcher.me/) with:

```bash
$ gem install mailcatcher
```

and then start the local SMTP server **before** starting the Rails app server with:

```bah
$ mailcatcher
```

Now you can browser the sent email by opening [http://localhost:1080](http://localhost:1080) in your browser.

#### Testing

SmallJobs is tested extensively, so make sure you do not break the specs before pushing to master.

```bash
$ rake spec
```

You may want to enable continous testing by running Guard:

```bash
$ bundle exec guard
```

## Configuration

This application uses several third-party services. All access keys and passwords are stored as a environmental variables.
These services are:
* S3 storage on Amazon AWS - used to store some images by Rich and Carrierwave gems. You can read about configuring it here: https://github.com/kreativgebiet/rich#uploading-to-s3 and here: https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave#using-amazon-s3
* Sendgrid - as smtp server. You should provide SENDGRID_USERNAME and SENDGRID_PASSWORD.
* Devise - used for authentication. Secret key and pepper are stored as DEVISE_SECRET and DEVISE_PEPPER
* Scout - for monitoring. Scout APM key is stored as SCOUT_KEY.

## Creating new administrator

In order to be able to create new administrator you must be administrator yourself.
If this is your first run of the application, then I suggest disabling checking for administrator role for admin panel.
To do so just comment out 
```ruby
config.authorize_with do
    redirect_to main_app.root_path unless current_admin != nil
  end
```
in the config/initializers/rails_admin.rb file.

Go to the admin panel (/admin). In the 'Administratoren' page create new administrator. Provide new email and password and save the changes.
Now when user logs in using that data he will be signed in as an administrator.

## Creating new region

First you need to setup new domain. To do this on Heroku:
* Go to the Heroku dashboard
* Open your app (be sure to get the one running on production)
* Go to the settings page
* Under the 'Domains and certificates' section click 'Add domain' button
* Enter domain name and save changes
* Make sure that domain is checked as 'Ok' (if not check domain name or your ssl certificate)

Before you can use new domain, you must prepare database data. The simplest way to do this is to use admin panel on existing domain.
Go to the admin panel (for example https://winterthur.smalljobs.ch/admin) and follow these steps:
1. Create new Region using domain name chosen before and populate it with some places.
2. Create new Organisation using one of places in created previously Region. You don't need to select brokers right now (but you can). Mark organization as active.
3. Create new Broker (or, if you are using existing one, skip this step). Select Organization created in previous step.
4. Create new Employment for Region, Organisation and Broker created in previous steps.
5. You should now be able to access new domain.
6. Optionally you can add more Organisations, Brokers and Employments to your new Region. Remember to always select places belonging tou your new Region.
